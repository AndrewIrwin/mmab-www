I started out in the lab doing a honours project on the metabolic
size scaling of Ditylum brightwellii (2009 to 2011). I completed a
MSc at Dal examining the transition from unicellular organisms to
multicellular organisms using bioinformatics laboratory experiments.
Presently I maintain cultures and equipment and assist with various
research projects.
