      <description>We are an interdisciplinary research group interested in large-scale ecological, evolutionary and biogeochemical phenomena in the oceans. Our primary goal is to understand and anticipate the effects of climate change on marine organisms, specifically phytoplankton using a combination of theoretical and data-driven models, remote-sensed, field and laboratory data, and the fossil record.
The MMaB Lab is located at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Members are affiliated with Oceanography and the Mathematics and Statistics departments.</description>

I am interested in understanding how single cell organisms can evolve to changes in climate.
Presently I am determining the potential of arctic phytoplankton to evolve to changing temperature.
For my PhD I worked on the utilization of organic nutrients in phytoplankton at the Alfred Wegner Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany. I&amp;rsquo;ve also worked at the Romberg Tiburon Center for Environmental Studies in San Francisco on the adaptation of calcifying phytoplankton to temperature and carbon dioxide concentration.</description>

I am interested in biochemical processes that dramatically alter the environment, such as photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, metal detoxification and methanogenesis.
Presently I am working on quantitative methods for proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. I also operate a small biotech company that I founded with two colleagues, called Environmental Proteomics. We develop proteomics tools and methods for plant sciences, oceanography, and a variety of microbial processes.</description>

I am a fourth-year honours student in biology. I am interested in how variations in the macromolecular composition of micro- and macroalgae impact marine ecosystems.
In the last year, I have done research on macroalgae. I first looked at the biases in the methods used to quantify macroalgae macromolecular content, and am now investigating the differences in average macromolecular composition between the three macroalgae phyla: the Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta, and Ochrophyta.</description>

I am interested in the cellular macromolecular composition of phytoplankton, and how various taxa change their composition during and after periods of environmental stress.
Currently I am quantifying the macromolecular composition of the species Micromonas at various points along its growth cycle. This microalgae has a broad pan-Arctic distribution and is present throughout the year. Their ecology and composition will be particularly important to track in response to arctic climate change.</description>

I am interested in researching the effects of global climate change on marine phytoplankton, to analyze the resulting climate feedbacks related to global carbon fixation.
Presently I am researching different traits amongst marine diatoms in effort to determine why some diatoms form chains, in conjunction to the method in which they do so. Understanding the reasoning of chain forming diatoms will provide further information of diatom life cycles, and their predicted future success within the effects of a globally changing climate system.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m broadly interested in marine spatial ecology and time series analysis of pelagic ecosystems ranging from the micro- to the macroscale.

My PhD was conducted in the NUI Galway where I examined the regional scale variability of plankton within Irish waters over the last 50 years, and tried to put into context these findings with the large scale shifts observed across the North Atlantic during that time.</description>

I am interested in the interplay of random drift and niche-mediated (non-neutral) processes in driving the dynamics and structure of ecological communities.
Currently I am designing hierarchical Bayesian models and Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithms to identify potential trait-based phytoplankton clusters and investigate whether such a clustering can enhance the predictive power of phytoplankton community biomass models.
For my PhD, I examined the prevailing assembly theories in community ecology, and developed comprehensive models of community dynamics with regard to neutral and niche-mediated factors.</description>

My research interests are in molecular biology and functional ecology, especially using omics-based methods to understand how microbial systems respond to changing conditions. I am particularly interested in studying gene expression and metabolic pathway, and how their modulation help cells to maintain homeostasis.
My current work involves the study of effects of crude oil spill on phytoplankton community. This involves the analysis of metatranscriptomic data generated during the mesocosm experiments, conducted with natural phytoplankton assemblages and seawater.</description>

I am interested in how environmental stressors such as light variability and nitrogen limitation affect the abundance of photosynthetic proteins in Micromonas, a species of picophytoplankton found in the Arctic.
My goal is to learn more about algal culturing along with qualitative and quantitative molecular biology techniques to conduct further analysis on Micromonas as well as other species of microalgae.</description>

I started out in the lab doing a honours project on the metabolic size scaling of Ditylum brightwellii (2009 to 2011). I completed a MSc at Dal examining the transition from unicellular organisms to multicellular organisms using bioinformatics laboratory experiments. Presently I maintain cultures and equipment and assist with various research projects.</description>

      <description>Title: Rosie Sheward Status: hidden

My main interest is in the evolution of coccolithophores (unicellular, calcite-producting phytoplankton). My research combines the study of both extinct and living phytoplankton to establish direct links between fossilized phytoplankton remains and present-day species and communities, bringing together approaches and datasets from the traditionally separate fields of phycology and micropaleontology.
I am presently investigating cellular stoichiometry and macromolecular composition in coccolithophores. This contributes to the wider research of lab members into the interactions between cellular resource requirements, resource availability, competitive species interactions, and biogeochemical cycles that ultimately drive the evolution of phytoplankton communities under climate change.</description>

Zoe V. Finkel Oceanography, Canada Research Chair in Marine Microbial Macroecology
My research interests focus on the eco-physiological controls of phytoplankton community structure, feedbacks between phytoplankton community structure and climate change, and the macroevolutionary history of phytoplankton communities.

      <description>We are an interdisciplinary research group interested in large-scale ecological, evolutionary and biogeochemical phenomena in the oceans. Our primary goal is to understand and anticipate the effects of climate change on marine organisms, specifically phytoplankton using a combination of theoretical and data-driven models, remote-sensed, field and laboratory data, and the fossil record.
The MMaB Lab is located at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Members are affiliated with Oceanography and the Mathematics and Statistics departments.</description>
