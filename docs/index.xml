      <description>We are an interdisciplinary research group interested in large-scale ecological, evolutionary and biogeochemical phenomena in the oceans. Our primary goal is to understand and anticipate the effects of climate change on marine organisms, specifically phytoplankton using a combination of theoretical and data-driven models, remote-sensed, field and laboratory data, and the fossil record.
The MMaB Lab is located at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Members are affiliated with Oceanography and the Mathematics and Statistics departments.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the lab group from our spring celebration. Congratulations in particular to our honours undergradute students: Sally Faulkner, Matt Fyfe, Akarsh Pai, and Catherine Fiset.
It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to get everyone together at the same time, but we did well.
Shown in the figure (L-to-R, F-to-B): Felicia, Catherine, Akarsh, Sally, Ina, Yue, Ruby, Kindy, Rosie, Niall, Zoe, Li, Doug (collaborator), Justin, Andrew, Wei (friend of the lab).

      <description>Sam Setta and Laura Bretherton visited our lab for a week to work on bioinformatic analysis of some GOMRI experiments.
We always try to be good hosts for our visitors &amp;ndash; this time in addition to lots of hard work this incldued a trip to Hopewell Rocks and Cora&amp;rsquo;s, a favourite local breakfast place.</description>

      <description>Sally Faulkner, Matt Fyfe, Akarsh Pai, and Catherine Fiset are summer research students working in the lab this summer. They are all busy growing cultures, performing assays, and helping out with lots of tasks around the lab.
This week Sally and Matt got a fun day at the beach to collect seawater for their lab cultures. Even indoor lab scientists need to get some sun now and then!</description>

Zoe V. Finkel Oceanography, Canada Research Chair in Marine Microbial Macroecology
My research interests focus on the eco-physiological controls of phytoplankton community structure, feedbacks between phytoplankton community structure and climate change, and the macroevolutionary history of phytoplankton communities. (Google scholar, Researcher ID B-9626-2008, ORCID 0000-0003-4212-3917, email: zfinkel at dal.ca.)
Andrew J. Irwin Mathematics &amp;amp; Statistics
I use mathematical and statistical models to study the marine biosphere, phytoplankton growth, and environmental influences on the distribution of phytoplankton in the ocean.</description>

      <description>We are looking to recruit researchers to join us at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.
We are looking for independent, creative scientists with a background in biological oceanography or plankton ecology and skills in one or more of the following areas: bioinformatics, particularly transcriptomics in non-model microbial eukaryotes, computational data analysis in macroecology, Bayesian statistics, phytoplankton culturing, biochemical assays, and molecular techniques.
Research opportunity for undergraduate students Opportunities are available for enthusiastic undergraduate students that would like research experience.</description>
