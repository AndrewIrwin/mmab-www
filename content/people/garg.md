I am interested in the cellular macromolecular composition of phytoplankton, and how various taxa change their composition during and after periods of environmental stress. 

Currently I am quantifying the macromolecular composition of the species _Micromonas_ at various points along its growth cycle. This microalgae has a broad pan-Arctic distribution and is present throughout the year. Their ecology and composition will be particularly important to track in response to arctic climate change.
