As a chemist, my expertise covers a broad spectrum of capabilities
including (1) chemistry, such as inorganic nanoparticles, organic
synthesis, analytical chemistry especially the nitrate optode in
microplate and analysis of biogenic silica; (2) biology, such as
purification and taxonomy of fossilized diatom in sediment, culturing,
automate fossilized diatom sample analysis with FlowCam.

My new goal is to learn more about assay analysis of microalgal
cells. In addition, I will maintain cultures, equipment and the
laboratory in good condition.
