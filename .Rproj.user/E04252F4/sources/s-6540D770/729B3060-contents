My research interests are in molecular biology and functional
ecology, especially using omics-based methods to understand how
microbial systems respond to changing conditions. I am particularly
interested in studying gene expression and metabolic pathway, and
how their modulation help cells to maintain homeostasis.

My current work involves the study of effects of crude oil spill
on phytoplankton community. This involves the analysis of
metatranscriptomic data generated during the mesocosm experiments,
conducted with natural phytoplankton assemblages and seawater. The
study will help to decipher the modulations in gene expression and
the metabolic pathways to understand the overall effect of crude
oil and the various strategies cells employ to overcome.
