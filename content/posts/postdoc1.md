Summary: Post-doctoral positions available 
---

We are looking for one or two post-doctoral research associates to
join the Marine Macroecology and Biogeochemistry Lab at Mount Allison
University in Sackville, New Brunswick, Canada. For information on
the lab go to www.mmab.ca. Two broad research areas are described
below. There is flexibility in the details of the projects which
will be designed to suit the skills and goals of the post-docs.

## Marine ecology

Species distribution models can be useful tools to characterize
species' niches, test for changes in niches, and make forecasts of
future species biogeography when combined with climate change
scenarios. I have several projects following up on recent work based
on oceanographic time-series of phytoplankton communities. I'm
looking for someone with knowledge of phytoplankton and zooplankton
ecology, modern statistical skills, and computing skills.

## Applied bioinformatics

I'm looking for someone with knowledge of bioinformatics, particularly
tools for analyzing RNAseq data from eukaryotic phytoplankton,
computing skills and an interest in developing new applications of
bioinformatic data in the service of ecological and physiological
research in biological oceanography. An background in microbial
ecology, photosynthesis, and biological oceanography would be an
asset but is not required.

For both positions, the post-doc could work primarily on data
analysis or could combine new experiments in the lab with analysis
of those data.

The initial appointment will be for one year and funding is in place
for up to two more years. To apply, send a c.v., outline of your
research goals, and contact information for three referees to Andrew
Irwin, airwin@mta.ca. Email inquiries are welcome.
