I am a fourth-year student completing an Honour in Economics and a
Major in Environmental Science. This summer, I am interested in
understanding the advantage and disadvantages associated with the
different chains formed by diatoms. Literature suggests that the
shape and length of chains appear to be determined by several
environmental factors, such as effectiveness of grazer defense
(Sournia 1982; Smetacek et al. 2004; Bergkvist et al. 2012),
adjustment of buoyancy (Smayda & Boleyn 1966; Smayda 1970; Takabayashi
et al. 2006) , optimization nutrient uptake through micro shear
(Reynolds 1984, Karp-Boss et al. 1996), and in pennate planktonic
diatoms, a possibility for entanglement of chains to retain proximity
for sexual reproduction (Kooistra 2007). My goal will be to gather
available data on diatom traits from the literature. This can then
be used to formulate new hypothesis about the purpose of chains or
provide better insight on the current ones.
