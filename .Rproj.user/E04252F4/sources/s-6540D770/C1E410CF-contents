I'm broadly interested in marine spatial ecology and time series
analysis of pelagic ecosystems ranging from the micro- to the
macroscale. I am particularly interested in the ways in which
organisms (especially zooplankton) respond to changes in the climate
regarding their distribution, niches and timing.

My PhD was conducted in the NUI Galway where I examined the regional
scale variability of plankton within Irish waters over the last 50
years, and tried to put into context these findings with the large
scale shifts observed across the North Atlantic during that time.

At MtA I will be investigating the realised niches of zooplankton
in vastly different areas, comparing species with similar traits
and also exploring how these niches may change through time.
