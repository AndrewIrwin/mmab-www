I am a biological oceanographer interested in understanding how
plankton communities in marine and aquatic ecosystems form and
change with environmental change due to natural or anthropogenic
disturbance, and its consequence to the biogeochemical processes
of the ecosystems.

I use quantitative approaches to mining the observational data, and
build models to investigate the diversity and structure of plankton
communities in a changing environment.
