## Zoe V. Finkel 
**Oceanography, Canada Research Chair in Marine Microbial Macroecology**

My research interests focus on the eco-physiological controls of
phytoplankton community structure, feedbacks between phytoplankton
community structure and climate change, and the macroevolutionary
history of phytoplankton communities.

## Andrew J. Irwin 
**Mathematics & Statistics**

I use mathematical and statistical models to study the marine biosphere, phytoplankton growth, and environmental influences on the distribution of phytoplankton in the ocean.
