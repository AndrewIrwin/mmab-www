I am interested in biochemical processes that dramatically alter the environment, such as photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, metal detoxification and methanogenesis.

Presently I am working on quantitative methods for proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. I also operate a small biotech company that I founded with two colleagues, called Environmental Proteomics.  We develop proteomics tools and methods for plant sciences, oceanography, and a variety of microbial processes.

For my PhD I studied the quotas and fates of macromolecular pools, including photosynthetic proteins and subcellular DNA fractions, in phytoplankton infected by viruses. I continued my work on marine algae, viruses and bacteria during a postdoc at Rutgers University in New Jersey.
