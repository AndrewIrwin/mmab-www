      <description>We are an interdisciplinary research group interested in large-scale ecological, evolutionary and biogeochemical phenomena in the oceans. Our primary goal is to understand and anticipate the effects of climate change on marine organisms, specifically phytoplankton using a combination of theoretical and data-driven models, remote-sensed, field and laboratory data, and the fossil record.
The MMaB Lab is located at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Members are affiliated with Oceanography and the Mathematics and Statistics departments.</description>
