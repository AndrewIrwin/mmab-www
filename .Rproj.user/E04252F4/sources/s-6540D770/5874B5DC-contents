My main interest is in the evolution of coccolithophores (unicellular,
calcite-producting phytoplankton). My research combines the study
of both extinct and living phytoplankton to establish direct links
between fossilized phytoplankton remains and present-day species
and communities, bringing together approaches and datasets from the
traditionally separate fields of phycology and micropaleontology.

I am presently investigating cellular stoichiometry and macromolecular
composition in coccolithophores. This contributes to the wider
research of lab members into the interactions between cellular
resource requirements, resource availability, competitive species
interactions, and biogeochemical cycles that ultimately drive the
evolution of phytoplankton communities under climate change.
