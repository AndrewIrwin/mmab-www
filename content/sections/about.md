We are an interdisciplinary research group interested in large-scale ecological, evolutionary and biogeochemical phenomena in the oceans.  Our primary goal is to understand and anticipate the effects of climate change on marine organisms, specifically phytoplankton using a combination of theoretical and data-driven models, remote-sensed, field and laboratory data, and the fossil record.

Researchers in our lab particpate in several large collaborative
research projects: [Computational Biogeochemical Modeling of Marine
Ecosystems](https://cbiomes.org/) (CBIOMES), [Simons Collaboration
on Ocean Processes and Ecology -
Gradients](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/microbial-oceanography/simons-collaboration-on-ocean-processes-and-ecology/scope-gradients/)
(SCOPE-Gradients), and [North West Atlantic Biological Carbon
Pump](http://nwa-bcp.ocean.dal.ca/) (NWA-BCP).

The MMaB Lab is located at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/)
in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.  Members are affiliated with
[Oceanography](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/oceanography.html) and
the [Mathematics and Statistics](https://mathstat.dal.ca/) departments.
We are members of the [Statistical Ecology Lab - SEaDAL](https://www.stat-ecol-dal.com/) at Dalhousie University.
The lab was located at and generously supported by [Mount Allison
University](https://www.mta.ca/) from 2004-2018.
