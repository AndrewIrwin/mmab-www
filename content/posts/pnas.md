Our study of phytoplankton niches at Station Cariaco show that phytoplankton
can evolve and change their niches over a 10-15 year period.
The figure below shows the distribution of mean phytoplankton niche for
temperature, irradiance, and nitrate concentration in a cooler period (blue)
and a warmer period (red). Temperature and irradiance niches shift to track 
changes in the environment. The niches of some phytoplankton shift to lower
nitrate concentrations as nitrate decreases in the environment, but many
phytoplankton niches remain effectively unchanged.
