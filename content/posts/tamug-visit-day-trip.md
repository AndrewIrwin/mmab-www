 Sam Setta and Laura Bretherton visited our lab for a week to work on bioinformatic analysis of some GOMRI experiments.

We always try to be good hosts for our visitors -- this time in addition to lots of hard work this incldued a trip to Hopewell Rocks and Cora's, a favourite local breakfast place.
