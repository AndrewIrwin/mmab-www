I am interested in how environmental stressors such as light
variability and nitrogen limitation affect the abundance of
photosynthetic proteins in _Micromonas_, a species of picophytoplankton
found in the Arctic.

My goal is to learn more about algal culturing along with qualitative
and quantitative molecular biology techniques to conduct further
analysis on _Micromonas_ as well as other species of microalgae.
