I am interested in researching the effects of global climate change
on marine phytoplankton, to analyze the resulting climate feedbacks
related to global carbon fixation.

Presently I am researching different traits amongst marine diatoms
in effort to determine why some diatoms form chains, in conjunction
to the method in which they do so.  Understanding the reasoning of
chain forming diatoms will provide further information of diatom
life cycles, and their predicted future success within the effects
of a globally changing climate system.

For my undergraduate degree, I am anticipating completing a bachelor
of science, with an honours major in earth science, following an
environmental science concentration at StFX.  Currently, I am
interested in global interactions between earthâ€™s spheres in relation
to climate change.
