I am interested in understanding how the macromolecular composition of microalgae is related to environmental and biotic conditions.

Presently I am studying the effect of nitrogen and phosphorus limitation on macromolecular composition of a size range of centric diatom species.

For my BSc I am completing a double major of Biology and Environmental Science (Hons.). I have a strong interest in biological oceanography, geology, and theatre.
