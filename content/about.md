We are an interdisciplinary research group interested in large-scale ecological, evolutionary and biogeochemical phenomena in the oceans.  Our primary goal is to understand and anticipate the effects of climate change on marine organisms, specifically phytoplankton using a combination of theoretical and data-driven models, remote-sensed, field and laboratory data, and the fossil record.

The MMaB Lab is located at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/) in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.
Members are affiliated with [Oceanography](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/oceanography.html) and the [Mathematics and Statistics](https://mathstat.dal.ca/) departments.
The lab was located at and generously supported by [Mount Allison University](https://www.mta.ca/) from 2004-2018.
