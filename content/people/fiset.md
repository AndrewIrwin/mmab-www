I am a fourth-year honours student in biology. I am interested in
how variations in the macromolecular composition of micro- and
macroalgae impact marine ecosystems.

In the last year, I have done research on macroalgae. I first looked
at the biases in the methods used to quantify macroalgae macromolecular
content, and am now investigating the differences in average
macromolecular composition between the three macroalgae phyla: the
Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta, and Ochrophyta.

I am currently working on my honours thesis project on an arctic
genus of phytoplankton called _Phaeocystis_. I will be culturing it
to determine how its macromolecular and elemental composition (C,
N, P) changes when it is limited for phosphorous or nitrogen.
