The first Simons CBIOMES workshop on Bayesian methods in plankton
modeling was held on January 8-10, 2020, at the Samberg Conference
Center on th MIT campus. Twenty eight participants represented all
10 of the CBIOMES Investigator labs. The workshop combined introductory
lectures, instruction in use of the "Stan" software toolkit, and
focused ‘hackathon’ time where participants tackled targeted problems
from their research using Bayesian statistical methodology. For
example, a group from USC, Flatiron and Dalhousie elucidated the
interaction network from a high resolution multivariate time series
of marine bacterial taxa.  A team from UW, MIT, Dalhousie, and USC
tested a novel parameterization relating bacterial division rates
and cell size distributions that significantly improved their ability
to quantify growth rates from continuous monitoring of cell size
distributions using the SeaFlow instrument. These are practical
advances towards real problems in monitoring and understanding the
dynamics of marine microbial communities.
