I am interested in the statistical processes which are required for
genome sequence analysis and how phytoplankton adapt when exposed
to oil rich environments. I am currently working on reconciling
the variances in data reporting and recording from the many different
phytoplankton collection centers across the world.  

I am a recent
graduate of Mount Allison and am looking to discover the various
fields which can benefit from regression and time series analysis.
For my masters and PhD I am hoping to do further research in
statistical analysis and how principals of Game Theory and other
behavioral theories impact environmental decisions which damage
non-voting actors.
