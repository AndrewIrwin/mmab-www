We are looking to recruit researchers to join us at Dalhousie
University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

We are looking for independent, creative scientists
with a background in biological oceanography or plankton ecology
and skills in one or more of the following areas: bioinformatics,
particularly transcriptomics in non-model microbial eukaryotes,
computational data analysis in macroecology, Bayesian statistics,
phytoplankton culturing, biochemical assays, and molecular techniques.

*If you are interested in joining our lab*, please review the information below. Send us a short email describing your research interests and goals and how they connect to the work in our lab.

# Research opportunity for undergraduate students

Opportunities are available for enthusiastic undergraduate students
that would like research experience. The research projects are
varied and interdisciplinary. Students with interests and background
in any combination of environmental science, math and computer
science, physics, chemistry and biology are welcome to contact Drs.
Irwin and/or Finkel. Please send a statement of your interests, a
description of your program of study, and an unofficial transcript.

We have already recruited undergraduate students for summer 2020 and we do not anticipate adding any more undergraduate students to our lab this year.

# Graduate student and Post-doctoral researcher opportunities

We are recruiting graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to
work on the Computational Biogeochemical Modeling of Marine Ecosystems
(CBIOMES) project. CBIOMES is an interdisciplinary, multi-institutional
project funded by the Simons Foundation to better understand the
biogeography of marine microbes and quantify the relationship between
microbial biogeography and elemental cycles using a combination of
modelling, statistical analyses of lab and field data, and laboratory
experiments.

We seek several graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to work
on one of the following projects:

1. Developing new models of phytoplankton growth and elemental
composition with a focus on macromolecular composition.  A major
goal of the project is to obtain new data on the growth rate and
macromolecular and elemental composition of ecologically and
biogeochemically important phytoplankton from across the tree of
life. We are also interested in integrating physiological and
biochemical data with transcriptomic data.  In aggregate these data
will be used to inform and constrain phytoplankton models of
biogeography and community composition.

2. Developing new approaches to modeling microbial biogeography.
Projects will employ computationally-intensive statistical analyses
of time-series data to develop species distribution models,
characterize microbial niches, and quantify microbial traits. Goals
include improved descriptions of species traits and niches,
intercomparison of model output and observational data, and new
efforts to connect empirically derived phytoplankton traits with
model parameterizations.

Detailed projects will be developed in collaboration with each
successful applicant.

Researchers will be given exposure to interdisciplinary research
and the opportunity to develop skills in a variety of areas including:
statistical analyses, bioinformatics, modelling, and laboratory
work. Ideally applicants will have an interest in, expertise or
familiarity with one or more of the following: phytoplankton culture,
oceanic cruise experience, physiological, biochemical and molecular
assays on phytoplankton, bioinformatics techniques especially
transcriptomics on non-model organisms, marine ecological modelling,
or computationally-intensive statistical analyses.

Students and post-doctoral fellows are to be housed at Dalhousie
University in the Oceanography or Mathematics and Statistics
departments to work with Dr. Zoe Finkel and Dr. Andrew Irwin. There
will be opportunities to interact with collaborating groups at MIT,
University of Washington, and the Simons Foundation. Researchers
will participate in collaboration meetings and workshops.

To apply, submit a PDF with a cover letter, curriculum vitae,
statement of research interests, and contact information for three
referees by email to zfinkel@dal.ca or a.irwin@dal.ca. We will
review applications as they are received. Informal inquiries are
welcome.

Dalhousie University is Atlantic Canada’s leading research-intensive
university and a driver of the region’s intellectual, social and
economic development. Located in the heart of Halifax, Nova Scotia,
with an Agricultural Campus in Truro, Dalhousie is a truly national
and international university, with more than half of our 18,500
students coming from outside of the province. Our 6,000 faculty and
staff foster a vibrant, purpose-driven community, that’s celebrating
200 years of academic excellence in 2018. The Department of
Oceanography has more than 20 faculty with diverse research interests
and supports more than 40 graduate students. The Department of
Mathematics and Statistics has more than 25 faculty and 40 graduate
students.

Dalhousie University is committed to fostering a collegial culture
grounded in diversity and inclusiveness. The university encourages
applications from Aboriginal people, persons with a disability,
racially visible persons, women, persons of minority sexual
orientations and gender identities, and all candidates who would
contribute to the diversity of our community. For more information,
