We are an interdisciplinary research group interested in large-scale ecological, evolutionary and biogeochemical phenomena in the oceans.  Our primary goal is to understand and anticipate the effects of climate change on marine organisms, specifically phytoplankton using a combination of theoretical and data-driven models, remote-sensed, field and laboratory data, and the fossil record.

Researchers in our lab participate in several large collaborative research projects:
[Computational Biogeochemical Modeling of Marine Ecosystems](https://cbiomes.org/) (CBIOMES),
[Simons Collaboration on Ocean Processes and Ecology - Gradients](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/microbial-oceanography/simons-collaboration-on-ocean-processes-and-ecology/scope-gradients/) (SCOPE-Gradients), and [Transforming Climate Action (TCA)](https://www.ofi.ca/programs/transform-climate-action) at the [Ocean Frontier Institute](https://ofi.ca/). Past projects include the 
[North West Atlantic Biological Carbon Pump](http://nwa-bcp.ocean.dal.ca/) (NWA-BCP) and [ADDOMEx](https://www.tamug.edu/phytoplankton/projects/addomex/index.html).

The MMaB Lab is located at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/) in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.
Members are affiliated with [Oceanography](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/oceanography.html) and the [Mathematics and Statistics](https://mathstat.dal.ca/) departments.
We are members of the [Statistical Ecology Lab - SEaDAL](https://www.stat-ecol-dal.com/) at Dalhousie University.
The lab was located at and generously supported by [Mount Allison University](https://www.mta.ca/) from 2004-2018.
